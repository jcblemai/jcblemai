### Welcome ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜Š

I am a researcher in infectious disease dynamics where I develop models that combine scientific knowledge and state-of-the-art statistical methods to guide effective policies from noisy, incomplete, and often misleading data. Most of my work concerns COVID-19, seasonal influenza or cholera.

Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, working within the [Atlantic Coast Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics](https://sph.unc.edu/sph-news/unc-gillings-school-to-host-new-cdc-center-for-outbreak-forecasting-response/) and Analytics (ACCIDDA), the [Insight Net](https://insightnet.us) coordinating center. My current projects include:
- [flepiMoP](https://www.flepimop.org) ([GitHub](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/flepiMoP)), an open-source flexible epidemic modeling pipeline that can simulate most compartmental models over a wide range of connected metapopulation setups. It has been used to track the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal influenza, providing forecasts and scenarios to decision-makers around the world.
 - [InfluPaint](https://github.com/jcblemai/inpainting-idforecasts), where we inpaint epidemic curves generated by denoising diffusion probabilistic models, to produce forecasts of influenza transmission in the U.S.
- [SMIDDY](https://www.smiddy.ch), aimed to foster the community of infectious disease modelers in Switzerland ðŸ‘¯.

Iâ€™m usually working from Vevey in SwitzerlandðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you pass by the Geneva Lake area, or even if you donâ€™t. Happy to discuss anything ðŸ¤”
