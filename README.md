### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher in infectious disease dynamics where I develop models that combine scientific knowledge and state-of-the-art statistical methods to guide effective policies from noisy, incomplete, and often misleading data. Most of my work concerns COVID-19, seasonal influenza or cholera.
Iâ€™m currently a post-doc with Justin Lessler and Jess K. Edwards at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, working on hybrid mechanistic/statistical models. My current projects include:
- [flepiMoP](flepimop.org) ([GitHub](https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/flepiMoP)), an open-source flexible epidemic modeling pipeline that can simulate most compartmental models over a wide range of connected metapopulation setups. It has been used to track the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal influenza, providing forecasts and scenarios to decision-makers around the world.
 - [InfluPaint](https://github.com/jcblemai/inpainting-idforecasts), where we inpaint epidemic curves generated by denoising diffusion probabilistic models, to produce forecasts of influenza transmission in the U.S.
- [SMIDDY](smiddy.ch), aimed to foster the community of infectious disease modelers in Switzerland ðŸ‘¯.

Iâ€™m usually working from Vevey in SwitzerlandðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you pass by the Geneva Lake area, or if you donâ€™t . Happy to discuss anythingðŸ¤”
